Four IITians started BlynQ on a mission to organize the outdoor marketing space. We built a Digital Signage platform from scratch to market. 
Few big hospital chains used our platform as a SAAS solution and were happy about the product.
Here's a short video about the product : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7MlJAq5tas

But, we couldn't generate the revenue that we anticipated for. 
So now, we're open sourcing the code for the UI and the backend server.

The Technology Stack include:
1. Django + Python
2. MySql
3. Angular
